# 501k demo site

This website uses Ruby on Rails.

## Git'n started

First, install `git` somehow. On the Mac, you should also install `gitx`.

Then, install `ruby-1.9.2` somehow. If you have `rvm` (*nix):
    rvm install ruby-1.9.2
    rvm use ruby-1.9.2
    rvm gemset create levi

`rvm` is not required though.

Then:
    git clone git@github.com:roy98102/levi.git
    cd levi
    # Answer 'y' if it asks you to trust the .rvmrc file.
    gem env gemdir

If you are using rvm, that should show something like:
    /Users/bgates/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p0@levi

Next:
    gem install bundler
    bundle install

Finally,
    rails server -p 3000

Visit:
  [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You should see the default Rails welcome screen:
> Welcome aboard
>
> You're riding Ruby on Rails!

## General guidelines.

* For commit messages, always give a summary line, then a blank line, then whatever details you want. E.g.

        git commit
        ---<editor starts up>---
        Added killer featureX.

        - Ported to Python.
        - Switched language to Turkish.

* (This is a Work In Progress.)

## Integration procedure.

We are using the *Integration Manager* workflow [Figure 5-2](http://progit.org/book/ch5-1.html). I will write some notes on that after I test it.

1. Develop a feature in a branch.

        git checkout -b feature master

1. When done, push the branch to your GitHub repo.

        git push origin feature

1. Within your levi fork on GitHub, issue a *pull request*.
1. Anyone can comment on the code. Converse! Look for errors, not style.
1. Any "Integration Manager" (anyone listed as a collaborator on the roy98102/levi repo) will test the commits, as described at GitHub at the bottom of the page where the *pull request* is discussed. It says this:

    > How to merge this pull request (called `feature` from `cdunn2001`):

   1. Check out a new branch to test the changes â€” run this from your project directory
 
            git checkout -b cdunn2001-feature master

   2. Bring in cdunn2001's changes and test
     
            git pull https://cdunn2001@github.com/cdunn2001/pulltest.git feature
    
   3. Merge the changes and update the server
     
            git checkout master
            git merge cdunn2001-feature
            git push origin master

    4. With that, the `feature` branch will *not* exist in roy98102, which is good. Only the changes on it have been merged into the `master` branch. 

1. The submitter (and others) may then pull in the latest master from roy98102.

	git remote add upstream git://github.com/roy98102/levi.git
	git fetch upstream
        git checkout master
        git merge upstream/master
	git push origin master

1. At that point, the submitter may delete the branch from his own repo.

        git checkout master
        git br -d feature
        git push origin :feature # to delete from GitHub

That's the full solution, but we can skip steps for simple changes that do not require testing. For those simple cases, we can take advantage of GitHub's [fork queues](https://github.com/blog/270-the-fork-queue). With that, the merge can occur entirely within GitHub.

The strange thing about the fork-queue is that *any* push you do to your GitHub repo will show up in the fork-queue. That makes your GitHub repo (usually called `origin`) very public.

Here are the simplified steps:

1. Develop on a feature branch.
1. Push to GitHub.
1. Issue *pull request* (but people could see it by checking their fork-queue* even if you do not).
1. Someone logs into roy98102 and checks the fork-queue. If the change is simple, he applies it to `master` (or eventually, to an integration branch), and updates the branch, all in GitHub.
1. Submitter will now see the merge-commit on his own fork-queue, which he can apply to `master` within GitHub.
1. He should then pull the change into his local `master`, just to stay in sync.
    git fetch origin
    git checkout master
    git merge origin/master

Try a few simple pull requests on your own `experimental` branch. I'll merge them into a throw-away `trash` branch for now.

Remember: Branch early and often!
